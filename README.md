# Group-Project
This is the Code 201 Final Project


# Problem Domain
    Intro: students in 201 have a hard time studying for their final technical exam. The available books inadequately assess their mastery of the subject matter. Having access to an app that tests their understand of subject matter will help them prepare for the exam, and provide them with extra confidence to believe in their coding abilities. 

    1. We want to create an app, which is essentially a quiz bank that allows users to test themselves in 5 Javascript subject  matters: 
            a. Functions
            b. Loops
            c. Object
            d. DOM
            e. LocalStorage 



#  User Story 
As a user I want the option to choose as many as 5 JS topics (functions, loops,object, DOM, LocalStorage) to be quizzed on

As a user, I want multiple choice questions.

As a user I want to see how many questions I got wrong and how many I got right

As a user, I want to know why I choose the wrong answer and why I choose the right answer

As a user I want to visually see which subject matter is my strong suit and which one is not so I not what to study 

As a user, I want to have a link referencing me to in-depth discussion of the question I got wrong. 

As a user, I want the interface to looks nice and be user friendly.


#Developper Story

1. As a developper, i want to  link the element in JS, use JS to dynamically render data to the DOM.
2. As a developper, I want to create a quiz-question object constructor with all the properties that I want to make up each quiz question instance. These properties will include:
    1. Subject areas
    2. Questions
    3. Multiple Choices 
    4. Answers Chosen by User
    5. Correct Answer to Question
    6. Incorrect Answer to Question
3. As a developer I want to instantiate new question objects.

4. As a developper, I want to store newly created quiz-question objects in a  variable, (an array) so I can access these properties and methods of this new objects from outside. 
5. As a developper, I want to  store users and check that answer against the correct answer property.
6. I want to have logical comparisons, if answer chosen by user is the same as correct answer, then I want to excute a code that say "correct". If if answer chosen by user is not same as correct answer, then I want to excute a code that say " incorrect".

7. As a developper, I want to store users input in local storage so that answers chosen can persist after page reloads.

8. As a developper I want users to populate a chart that shows users which subject area they master and which ones they do not after the exam is over

9. As a developer, I want when the event of choosing an aswer is fired, I want function that register answer, that checks if answer is correct, and that gives a response of "correct" or incorrect". i want an event handler that holds all these functions
